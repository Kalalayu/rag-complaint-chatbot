# RAG Complaint Chatbot

**Description:**  
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for analyzing customer complaints. It combines a pre-built vector store of complaint data with a language model to answer user questions based on retrieved context. The system includes:

- **Retriever:** Fetches the most relevant text chunks from the vector store.
- **Prompt Builder:** Structures the context for the language model.
- **Generator:** Produces answers based on retrieved context.
- **Evaluation:** Qualitative assessment of answers on representative questions.

The pipeline demonstrates how RAG enhances domain-specific question answering by integrating retrieval and generation in a single workflow.
