# rag-complaint-chatbot
A RAG-based system that turns customer complaints into searchable, actionable insights across financial products.
# Intelligent Complaint Analysis with RAG

This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that helps internal teams at a financial institution analyze customer complaints at scale.

## Problem Overview
Customer complaints contain valuable insights but are difficult to analyze manually due to volume and unstructured text. This system enables stakeholders to ask natural language questions and receive evidence-backed answers powered by real customer complaints.

## Key Features
- Semantic search over customer complaints using vector embeddings
- Support for multiple financial products (credit cards, loans, savings, transfers)
- LLM-powered question answering grounded in retrieved complaints
- Modular and extensible architecture
